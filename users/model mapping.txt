For the model mapping of the UserProfile, there would be

1. Profile image
    - There would be a folder in the data base containing the previous profile images too
    - There would also be the cropping of the profile image
2. Ranking
    - I really can't think of the ranking stuff but it would be like stack overflow ranking. It would be something like followers but its not followers since its not a social media app. Its more like the stars you gain via contribution to the Forum Community.
    - There would be asked_questions counts. This is the count of your asked question 
    - There would be answered_question counts. This is the count of your answered question 
    - There would be reach count; The number of people your question reached.
